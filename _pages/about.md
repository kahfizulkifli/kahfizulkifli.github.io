Hi! My name is Kahfi, and I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Virginia, advised by [Prof. Chang Lou](https://changlousys.github.io/). I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science from Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB), Indonesia.  

I work on Computer Systems, with an emphasis on **Systems Verification and Reliability**. I have 3 years of experience in conducting research with [Prof. Haryadi Gunawi](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~haryadi/) on the intersection between machine learning and systems.

## News
* 2025/2: Our workshop paper on detecting silent errors in Large ML Models with Formal Verification has been accepted by [EuroMLSys ‘25](https://euromlsys.eu/) (co-located with EuroSys 2025). Credits to Chang, Wenbo, and also AWS researchers for their insights.
* 2025/1: Paper on reducing tail latencies in SSDs with machine learning-powered I/O admission policy just got accepted at [EuroSys '25](https://2025.eurosys.org/). Thanks Dan, Rani, Peiran, Ray, and Prof. Har.
* 2024/8: Arrived at Charlottesville to start PhD
* 2024/4: Graduated from Institut Teknologi Bandung.
* 2024/2: Accepted PhD offer at University of Virginia.
* 2023/12: I successfully defended my Bachelor's thesis!
